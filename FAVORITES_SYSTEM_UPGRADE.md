# Favorites System Upgrade

## Overview

The favorites system has been upgraded from localStorage-based to API-based synchronization to resolve issues with heart icons not updating correctly when favorites are removed from other pages.

## Problem Solved

**Previous Issue:**
- When a user (visitor) removed an exhibitor from favorites in the "My Favourites" page, the heart icon in the exhibitor directory page remained red
- This was caused by localStorage not being properly synchronized between different pages
- The exhibitor directory page was using localStorage to track favorites, but the favorites page was updating the API without properly updating localStorage

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed localStorage Dependency
- **Exhibitor Directory Page** (`src/app/iframe/exhibitors/page.tsx`): Now uses API calls to check favorite status
- **Visitors Page** (`src/app/iframe/visitors/page.tsx`): Now uses API calls to check favorite status  
- **Favorites Page** (`src/app/[identifier]/event-admin/favourites/page.tsx`): Removed localStorage updates

### 2. Created FavoritesManager Utility
- **File**: `src/utils/favoritesManager.ts`
- **Purpose**: Centralized utility for managing favorites with API-based synchronization
- **Features**:
  - `checkExhibitorFavoriteStatus()`: Check if an exhibitor is favorited by a visitor
  - `checkVisitorFavoriteStatus()`: Check if a visitor is favorited by an exhibitor
  - `toggleExhibitorFavorite()`: Toggle exhibitor favorite status for a visitor
  - `toggleVisitorFavorite()`: Toggle visitor favorite status for an exhibitor
  - `getVisitorFavoriteExhibitors()`: Get all favorite exhibitors for a visitor
  - `getExhibitorFavoriteVisitors()`: Get all favorite visitors for an exhibitor

### 3. Added localStorage Cleanup
- **File**: `src/utils/clearFavoritesStorage.ts`
- **Purpose**: Clean up legacy localStorage data during app startup
- **Provider**: `src/components/providers/FavoritesCleanupProvider.tsx`
- **Integration**: Added to main layout to run on app startup

## How It Works Now

### For Visitors (Exhibitor Favorites)
1. **Adding to Favorites**: 
   - User clicks heart icon in exhibitor directory
   - `FavoritesManager.toggleExhibitorFavorite()` is called
   - API updates the database
   - UI immediately reflects the change
   - When user visits "My Favourites" page, it loads from API

2. **Removing from Favorites**:
   - User clicks heart icon in "My Favourites" page
   - `FavoritesManager.toggleExhibitorFavorite()` is called
   - API updates the database
   - UI immediately reflects the change
   - When user visits exhibitor directory, it loads from API

### For Exhibitors (Visitor Favorites)
1. **Adding to Favorites**:
   - User clicks heart icon in visitors directory
   - `FavoritesManager.toggleVisitorFavorite()` is called
   - API updates the database
   - UI immediately reflects the change

2. **Removing from Favorites**:
   - User clicks heart icon in "My Favourites" page
   - `FavoritesManager.toggleVisitorFavorite()` is called
   - API updates the database
   - UI immediately reflects the change

## Key Benefits

1. **Consistent State**: All pages now use the API as the single source of truth
2. **Real-time Updates**: Changes made on one page are immediately reflected on other pages
3. **No localStorage Conflicts**: Eliminates issues with localStorage not being synchronized
4. **Better Error Handling**: Centralized error handling in FavoritesManager
5. **Cleaner Code**: Removed complex localStorage management logic

## Migration Process

1. **Automatic Cleanup**: The `FavoritesCleanupProvider` automatically clears legacy localStorage data on app startup
2. **Seamless Transition**: Users won't notice any interruption - the system just works better
3. **Backward Compatibility**: If API calls fail, the system gracefully handles errors

## API Endpoints Used

- `POST /api/{identifier}/Event/addFavorites` - Add/remove favorites
- `GET /api/{identifier}/Event/getVisitorFavorites?visitorId={id}` - Get visitor's favorite exhibitors
- `GET /api/{identifier}/Event/getFavorites?exhibitorId={id}` - Get exhibitor's favorite visitors

## Testing

To test the new system:

1. **Add a favorite**: Go to exhibitor directory, click heart icon → should turn red
2. **Check favorites page**: Go to "My Favourites" → should show the exhibitor
3. **Remove favorite**: Click heart icon in favorites page → should remove from list
4. **Verify sync**: Go back to exhibitor directory → heart should be white

The heart icons should now stay synchronized across all pages!
